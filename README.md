This repo demonstrate how we can find the difference in weather between June and December in Hawaii  using SQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Python, Pandas, statistical analysis for a surf and ice cream store in Hawaii.

1    hawaii.sqlite - data source file 

2    climate_analysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook notes

3    app.py - Python code with routes for Flask showing sqlite file data

4   surfs_challenge.ipynb - Jupyter notebook of python code showing the final analysis




**Results**

1  Below is the data we've found by looking at all the June and December months temperatures across our entire data set (2010-01-01 to 2017-08-23).

From the analysis of the data, we can see that in June temperature is perfect for surfing and having some ice cream.Maximum temperature is 85 and minimum is 64 in the month of June.


2  In December also temperature is almost same like june but only difference is that min temperature in December is 56.


3 Based on the data, we can see that the peak season starts in June and is most favourable for surfing and ice cream sales. As the weather is getting cooler in December, it will be the tail end of the season.





**Summary**


With the data and analysis at hand we do not know when are rains occurring, if it is during the day or at night.
We also do not know how frequent rain is occurring on a month by month basis.


I recommend we should do some analysis on  any chance of rain occurrence, then filter and understand rain pattern during business hours on these months.

Also we can find which are the busy months in a year so we can keep more surfing boards.

Any other months suitable for surfing other than June and December.
